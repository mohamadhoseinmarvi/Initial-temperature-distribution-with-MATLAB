Differential equations are at the heart of many engineering problems. They appear in fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, vibration analysis, and many other areas. For most of the problems that appear in practice, we cannot find an analytical solution and must rely on numerical techniques. Applications of linear algebra appear particularly in what are termed initial-boundary value problems. In problems like these, an initial condition is known at t = 0, and the value of the solution is known on the boundary of an object. We must use these known values to approximate the solution in the interior of the object.
